    "# Graphs and Treaversal\n",
    "On this notebook we will learn about graph traversing which basically is a way to visit all nodes in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](docs/imgs/simple_graph.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depth First Search (DFS)\n",
    "This way of traversing the graph will use a stack and will go down the tree until the last possible node, after we get to the bottom of the graph we pop from the end of the stack more nodes and visit more nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breadth First Search (BFS)\n",
    "This way of traversing the graph will use a queue by first visting all nodes connected to the current node, then we go and get a node on the front of the queue and visit all nodes adjacent of this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which one to use\n",
    "If you need to find a path on a unweighted graph, use BFS, if you need for example to discover the height of the graph use DFS, both algorithms will traverse the graph.\n",
