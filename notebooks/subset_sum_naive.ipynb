    "# Subset Sum Problem (Naive Sollution)\n",
    "Given a set of non-negative integers, and a value sum, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equal to given sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Input:  set[] = {3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2}, sum = 9\n",
    "Output:  True  //There is a subset (4, 5) with sum 9.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NP\n",
    "This is a NP-Complete problem because it's sollution is exponential time but is really easy to know if one subset is actually the sollution.\n",
